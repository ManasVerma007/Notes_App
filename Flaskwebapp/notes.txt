main.py notes -->

we use 'from website import create_app' because our 'website' is now a package... how? 
-> because we used __init__.py in the templates section.

Therefore we can now import any other file in the main.py 

views.py notes -->

this file is a blueprint of our application --it has bunch of roots inside ie: urls .....we can find different views of our application in 
different files rather than having them to find in one file(because it contains the urls to go to those views).

HTTP REQUEST

( reference of login and sign-up page ) 
when we go to the url using the url bar it is the "get request" annd when we push the 
submit button then it is the "post request" (now(after adding the string of requests
to the auth.py file) the login and sign-up page do not throw error whereas they tend to reload. )

FETCHING DATA USING post

def login():
    # return render_template("login.html",text="testing",user="ghosty")
    data=request.form 
    print(data)
    return render_template("login.html")

    request that was sent to access this route eg : some url , some method and in this case the form attribute of the request containing all the data sent as the part of the form
